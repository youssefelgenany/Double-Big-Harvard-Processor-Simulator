# Double-Big-Harvard-Processor-Simulator
This repository provides a complete C simulator for a fictional “Double Big Harvard” processor design. It models a Harvard memory system with 1024×16-bit instruction memory and 2048×8-bit data memory, a register file of 64 general-purpose 8-bit registers plus status (SREG) and program-counter registers, and implements 12 core instructions (ADD, SUB, MUL, ANDI, EOR, SAL, SAR, etc.) that update carry, overflow, negative, sign, and zero flags as specified. The simulator executes every instruction through a three-stage pipeline (Fetch, Decode, Execute), with cycle counting based on a 3 + (n–1) formula. Included are sample programs, detailed build instructions (via GCC/Makefile), and test cases to validate correct flag behavior, memory access, and pipeline timing.
